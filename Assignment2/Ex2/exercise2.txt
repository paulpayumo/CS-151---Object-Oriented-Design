The main difference between int and integer is that int is simply a 32bit representation of a value, whereas integer is a class
which wraps an int into an object. Thus, int requires less memory, and is useful for storing numbers. While integer is larger in memory, 
but can be used to change int into other formats such as string, or hexadecimal representations. Int is more useful in instances which 
doesn't require too much flexibility on its value, or too much memory. Whereas the class integer is usefull for getting int as a string 
representation, or even changing its values using functions inside the class.
